## Abstract
Detecting people and their attributes in natural conditions is one of the basic tasks of computer vision
systems. Unfortunately, all known algorithms do not provide even the slightest protection of data
privacy. In this paper we fill this gap. We propose a system for detecting people while maintaining data
privacy thanks to the learnable perceptual encryption of an image immediately after its acquisition
and before detection. A novelty is our proposed version of YOLO detector, equipped with original
input layers that enable effective detection in encrypted images. This is possible thanks to the use
of the Lipschitz cost function and original attention modules. The experimental results using images
from various everyday situations, obtained both in the visible spectrum and in the thermal band,
prove the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available on GitHub.
